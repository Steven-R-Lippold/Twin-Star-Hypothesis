# Twin-Star-Hypothesis Repository
This repository contains the source code for the MATLAB-based computational work for the article "Twin-star hypothesis and cycle-free $d$-partitions of $K_{2d}$" by Matthew Fyfe, Steven Lippold, Mihai Staic, and Alin Stancu. More specifically, in the article, the theory had reduced a conjecture known as the Twin-Star Hypothesis down to the statement that every cycle-free edge 4-partition of the complete graph K_8 is weakly equivalent to the Twin-Star Graph with 8 vertices or an edge partition such that one of its graphs in the edge partition is the graph T_19. Using the work in this repository, it was shown computationally that these two cases are weakly equivalent, which proves the Twin-Star Hypothesis in the case of cycle-free edge 4-partitions of K_8.

## MATLAB Files
The MATLAB work was conducted in three steps, which is given in this repository as three .m files:
1. Partition Generation: This first step generates all of the relevant partitions. Keep in mind we are considering these partitions up to weak equivalence, given the Symmetric Group actions on edge 4-partitions.
2. Klein Group Action: 
3. Check for TS_4:
